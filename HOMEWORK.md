# Assignment
Solve the following problems and provide some explanation of how you did so.

## Try to solve the following double transpositions, and check them with the provided decoder!
**Message:** ``OODNUFUYTN**IOSAHLCGEFATNALUGRTO``  
**Keys:** ``Terrison`` ``Anna``

**Message:** ``EIMRILWMLSTAHTWEAOESSK*ITN*ILESTESIH``  
**Keys:** ``Naga`` ``Julian``

## Try to encode the following messages using a double transposition cipher, and check them with the provided encoder!

**Plaintext:** ``We are discovered flee at once``  
**Keys:** ``Courier`` ``Zebra``

## Bonus: (no need to submit)
In the ``encode-decode-crack`` folder, there is a file named ``encode.txt`` and ``wordlist.txt``.

Use ``crack.java`` with the ``-H`` flag and the two files to find the message.

**Note:** If the program doesn't generate a new string after 3-4 minutes, it is probably at a local maximum and you would rerun the program.

The "score" for the string is 2341.
